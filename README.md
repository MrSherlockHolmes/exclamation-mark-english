# exclamation-mark-english
> This is English for programmers. It's `!english`.

exclamation-mark-english (`!english`) is a parser for a simplified, perhaps more programmer-like subset of English.  
It's being developed by [kvackkvack](https://github.com/kvackkvack) and [nanalan](https://github.com/nanalan), but don't expect it to go anywhere.
